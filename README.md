### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Evan

- I'm currently working on the [dioxus](https://github.com/dioxuslabs) framework.
- I'm interested in cross plaftorm development, and private, controllable AI.

I am building, [Kalosm](https://floneum.com/kalosm), a multimodal library for pertained local AI models in rust called. If that sounds interesting, **consider joining the [discord](https://discord.gg/dQdmhuB8q5)**
