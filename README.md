### Hi there 👋 I'm Evan

- I'm currently working on the [Dioxus](https://github.com/dioxuslabs) framework and [skyvm](https://skyvm.dev)
- I'm interested in cross-platform UI, and private, controllable AI.

I am building [Kalosm](https://floneum.com/kalosm), a library for local AI inference in rust. If that sounds interesting, **consider joining the [discord](https://discord.gg/dQdmhuB8q5)**
