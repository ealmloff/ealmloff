- I'm currently working on the [dioxus](https://github.com/dioxuslabs) UI framework as a member of [dioxus labs](https://github.com/dioxuslabs) and a maintainer of dioxus.
- I'm interested in cross plaftorm development, and local AI.

I'm working on [Floneum](https://floneum.com/) an open source graph editor for workflows that use local AI models.
To support Floneum, I am building a multimodal library for pretrained models in rust called [Kalosm](https://floneum.com/kalosm).
