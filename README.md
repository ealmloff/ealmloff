- I'm currently working on the [dioxus](https://github.com/dioxuslabs) webframework.
- I'm interested in the future of web development, incremental computation, and natural language processing.
- I'm a member of [dioxus labs](https://github.com/dioxuslabs) and a maintainer of dioxus.
- I'm also working on [rink](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/tui) a TUI render for Dioxus, [sledgehammer-bindgen](https://github.com/Demonthos/sledgehammer_bindgen) the world's fastest JavaScript rust binding library and [blitz](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz) a WGPU renderer for Dioxus

I'm working on [Floneum/Kalosm](https://floneum.com/) an open source graph editor for workflows that use local AI models.
To support Floneum, I am building a multimodal metaframework for AI in rust that uses Candle and Llama.cpp called [Kalosm](https://github.com/floneum/floneum/tree/master/kalosm).
